# DoubleLinked-Lists
An implementation of a double linked list in C

## Installation

There is no necessary libraries to run the code except the ones included in the files. The code runs with no issues using 
standard C.

## Project Motivation

This project was part of a coding test and I decided to uploaded here.

## File Description

* list.h: where the structures, functions and variables are declared.
* list.c: where functions of a double link list are implemented. 
* main.c: where a double link list is created and its functions are called. Additionally, ``assert()`` fucntion is used to
perform tests.

## Results

There are shown when running the ``main.c`` file.
